# Section 3: Franz and Other Lists

>To criticize is to appreciate, to appropriate, to take intellectual possession, to establish in fine a relation with the criticized thing and to make it one's own.  
>&mdash;Henry James

Section 3 contains a bunch of stuff
that didn't fit in anywhere else in the book. Most of it can be viewed as lists
of one sort or another. You'll find our hardware recommendations, our
opinionated list of useless commands to avoid, optimization tips, and a
collection of weird items that make you think you've found a bug.
