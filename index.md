### Section 1: Wow, What a Concept!

>Ignorance is preferable to error; and he is less remote from the truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong.  
>&mdash;Thomas Jefferson, *Notes on the State of Virginia*, 1781-1785

Section 1 introduces the major themes
of Visual FoxPro, starting with its history and covering the fundamentals of
each of its major sub-languages. Think of it as the "If it's Tuesday, this
must be Belgium" Tour of Visual FoxPro.

### Section 2: Ship of Tools

>Man is a tool-using animal...Without tools he is nothing, with tools he is all.  
>&mdash;Thomas Carlyle, *Sartor Resartus*, 1833-1834

Section 2 discusses in brief the Power
Tools&mdash;the key to using Visual FoxPro effectively. You'll find our favorite tips
and tricks for using the Power Tools here, too, and an introduction to
integrating source control with VFP development.

### Section 3: Franz and Other Lists 

>To criticize is to appreciate, to appropriate, to take intellectual possession, to establish in fine a relation with the criticized thing and to make it one's own.  
>&mdash;Henry James

Section 3 contains a bunch of stuff
that didn't fit in anywhere else in the book. Most of it can be viewed as lists
of one sort or another. You'll find our hardware recommendations, our
opinionated list of useless commands to avoid, optimization tips, and a
collection of weird items that make you think you've found a bug.

[Hardware and Software Recommendations](section3/s3c1.md)

### Section 4: Visual FoxPro Reference

> "But 'glory' doesn't mean 'a nice knockdown argument'," Alice objected.
<br>"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less."
<br>"The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many different things."
<br>"The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master—that's all."
<br>&mdash;Lewis Carroll, *Through the Looking-Glass*, 1872

Section 4 is the meat of the book. You'll find a listing for every command, function, property, event, method and system variable. We've grouped them logically so that you can find several related topics in one place. For an explanation of the syntax we use for commands, see ["How to Use This Book"](section1/s0c8.md).

### Section 5: But Wait, There's More!

>We will now discuss in a little more detail the Struggle for Existence.  
>&mdash;Charles Robert Darwin, *The Origin of Species*, 1859

We've sliced, we've diced, we've chopped Visual FoxPro into
little pieces. But there's still more to say. A few features are so cool, they
warrant their own chapters. This section goes into detail on the ActiveX
technologies, the Object Browser and Component Gallery, Wizards and Builders,
and IntelliSense, all of which provide opportunities for extending your use of
VFP.

[Builders and Wizards (and Bears, Oh My!)](section5/s5c3.md)

[IntelliSense and Sensibility](section5/s5c4.md)

### Section 6: Back o' da Book

>Great is the art of beginning, but greater the art is of ending;<br>
 Many a poem is marred by a superfluous verse.  
>&mdash;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Here we are at the end of the book. But there are still a
couple of things left to do. "Resource File" is a list of resources:
books, periodicals, people and products. "What's in the Downloads"
tells you what's available for download from this book.
