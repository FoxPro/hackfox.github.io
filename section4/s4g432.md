## `DISPLAY TABLES`, `LIST TABLES`

These two commands produce a list of the tables in a database. Each is listed with both its internal name and its complete path and file name.

### Usage

```foxpro
DISPLAY | LIST TABLES
        [ TO PRINT [ PROMPT ]
          | TO [ FILE ] cFileName [ ADDITIVE ] ]
        [ NOCONSOLE ]
```

Like the other commands that `LIST DATABASE` components, these insist you open the database and make it current before using them.

The information displayed is more or less available from a combination of `ADBOBJECTS()` and `DBGetProp()`.

### Example

```foxpro
OPEN DATA TasTrade
LIST TABLES TO PRINT
```
