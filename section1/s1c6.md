## Controls and KAOS

>Who controls the past controls the future;
 who controls the present controls the past.
>&mdash;George Orwell, *1984*

Controls are the means of interacting with users. Some, like
the text box and the command button, are visual elements of the user interface;
others, like the timer and the session controls, don't have a visual element,
but work behind the scenes to support the user interface. Understanding the
intricate ways in which the properties, events and methods are evaluated and
executed is essential to grasping how Visual FoxPro works. In this section,
we'll discuss what controls are and some of the features common to controls.
We'll go on to look briefly at each control (you'll find more in the Reference
section), and discuss where it's appropriately used. At the end of the
discussion, we'll explain how the built-in characteristics of controls can be
extended to create more complex and customized controls, tailored to meet your
clients' needs, capable of interacting with your users in ways beyond those
anticipated by Visual FoxPro's designers. 

### What's a control?

Most controls are objects that are manipulated, like light
switches, sliders or radio buttons, and hence can be thought of as computer
representations of real-world controls. This metaphor falls a bit short,
however, for some controls, such as the timer, which doesn't have a visual
representation, is invisible to the end user, and can't be "grasped."
For our purposes, we think a sufficient definition is that controls are the objects
on forms that perform specific actions when acted upon by an event generated by
the user interface, program code or the system.

Controls can be placed on a form in a number of ways. The
simplest is to use the Form Controls toolbar. However, some of the other approaches
offer more power, including dragging fields from the Data environment or
controls from the Component Gallery. Properties, events and methods contain the
information that determines what a control looks like, what characteristics it
has, and what it should do when acted upon. Hence, the control's appearance and
behavior is *encapsulated* within the
control&mdash;one of the key principles of object-oriented programming. (See
"OOP is Not an Accident" for more on the principles of object
orientation and how they're implemented in Visual FoxPro.) The properties of
forms and controls are changed through the Property Sheet. Their events and
methods can be customized using the method code editor.

While there appear to be a dazzling number of properties,
events and methods associated with the collection of controls (in fact, there
are more than 2,660 combinations of controls with properties, events and
methods), many of the properties, events and methods are common to most
controls and perform the same function (or a very similar function) for most of
them. Hence, they can be understood just as easily with a blanket statement
rather than repeating something like "The Top property determines how far
from the top of its container the control appears" in each control's reference
section. In fact, we don't repeat that information in the Reference section of
this book. The tables there list only those PEMs (that's common shorthand for
"properties, events and methods") that are of particular interest for
that control. The VFP Help does contain complete lists for each control.

Here is a quick synopsis of the most common PEMs.

#### Common Control Properties

A property is nothing more than a characteristic of an
object. Properties describe things like the object's height, width, color, and
whether the object should have certain capabilities, such as being enabled or
being visible. Properties are manipulated in Visual FoxPro in pretty much the
same manner as memory variables, and can be thought of in many respects as
private memory variables scoped to a single control. 

There are two common ways to manipulate the properties of a control: at runtime using assignment commands and during development using the design mode tools. (In fact, you can manipulate properties programmatically at design-time, too. See ["Builders and Wizards and Bears, Oh My!"](..\section5\s5c3.html) for more on this.) To refer to properties programmatically, use the "dot notation" explained in ["OOP is Not an Accident"](s1c5.html)&mdash;as in:

```foxpro
ThisForm.PageFrame1.Page7.Command1.Caption = "OK"
```
You're probably thinking, "I've got to type all
that?" No, not always; rarely, in fact. IntelliSense is there to help out.
See ["IntelliSense and Sensibility"](..\section5\s5c4.html) for more details on how
IntelliSense helps make these object references easy to get into your code.

Properties are assigned visually using the Property Sheet.
Formally, Microsoft calls this the "Properties Window" but we've
gotten used to the "Sheet" terminology, especially since this window
is often set to be "always on top" (see the right-click menu for that
option)&mdash;something that seems more intuitive for a sheet than a window. We've
heard it variously called the "Properties Form," "Property
List," "Properties Sheet," "Property Sheet" and
"PropSheet." We think all are fine, as long as folks know what you're
talking about. Let's review some of the more common properties and what they
are usually used for:

The `Name` property
of a control does what it says: tells you the control's name. You use the name
to refer to the control programmatically.

`Parent` provides
an object reference to the object containing the control. For a control sitting
right on a form, for example, Parent holds a reference to the form. For a
control on a page of a page frame, Parent contains a reference to the page.
Parent helps you climb up from the control you're on to the outside world. This
is the containership hierarchy, not to be confused with the inheritance
hierarchy&mdash;see `ParentClass`, below, for that.

`Value` holds
whatever the control currently contains, generally some variation on the user's
input. `ControlSource` lets you bind
the control's Value to a field, variable or property&mdash;when Value changes, so
does the item named in ControlSource.

The control's location and size are specified with the `Top`, `Height`, `Left `and `Width `properties. All of these measurements
are expressed in units determined by the object's `ScaleMode`&mdash;either pixels or foxels. (Stick with pixels&mdash;we haven't
come across any good reasons to use foxels.)

Font characteristics are specified with the `FontName`, `FontSize`, `FontBold`, `FontUnderline`, `FontStrikethru` and `FontItalic`
properties&mdash;almost all controls have these. The `FontCondense`, `FontExtend`,
`FontOutline` and `FontShadow` properties are oddballs, included for compatibility with
the Macintosh but having no effect on Windows fonts. (By the way, if you want
to use the Transparent characteristic of fonts, it's only available using the
old FoxBase STYLE "T" clause on those commands that support it.)

The `Comment` and `Tag` properties have no designed use.
They're there to provide a place to leave notes or do whatever you want. We
haven't seen very many people actually use these properties. On the whole, it
seems better to add custom properties as needed. The term `Tag`, by the way, is a
carryover from Visual Basic, and is not at all related to the tags Visual
FoxPro uses in its indexes.

The `Enabled`
property determines whether an object is capable of reacting to external events
like clicking, typing, or tabbing to a control. A disabled control is
"grayed-out" and can't be accessed. 

Color settings for a control can be specified in a number of
ways. The most obvious are the properties `BorderColor`,
`ForeColor` and `BackColor`, with their equivalents of `DisabledForeColor` and `DisabledBackColor`,
which apply when the object's `Enabled` property is False. However, in most cases
you'll want to use the `ColorSource`
property instead, so the control's colors are based on the user's Windows
system choices. A number of controls also have other color settings that affect
particular aspects of their appearance (such as `ItemForeColor` and `FillColor`).

The `BaseClass`, `Class`, `ParentClass` and `ClassLibrary`
properties describe the pedigree and history of a control, and are fixed at the
time a control is created. These allow you, at runtime or design-time, to
examine the lineage of a control and act appropriately. 

A couple of properties help you hook your controls into your
Help system. `HelpContextID` and `WhatsThisHelpID` each contain an
identifier for the control that can link to a Help entry.

Every VFP object has the `Application` property. It contains an object reference to the
instance of Visual FoxPro in which that object was created. For self-contained
applications (the kind that use only VFP), there's not too much use for this
property. However, when a VFP application is started by another application,
this reference gives you a handle to the VFP engine. (See ["It was
Automation, You Know"](s1c9.html) for an explanation of why another application might
run a VFP application.)

#### Common Control Events

<table>

  <td width="20%" valign="top">
<img width="94" height="94" src="design.gif">

  <td width="80%">
  <p>Events introduce some difficulties in talking about Visual FoxPro. When we speak of &quot;adding code to the MouseDown event,&quot; it is easy for our audience to sense that an event is somehow a different kind of thing from a method. This is a linguistic issue, not a complication of Visual FoxPro. An event is an occurrence that is communicated to your application. This event might be the fact that the mouse is passing over a control, or that a timer's Interval has elapsed. When your application, via the underlying FoxPro engine, receives this message, a method with the same name as the event is run automatically. So when we talk about modifying the MouseDown event, we are really speaking of &quot;the method associated with the MouseDown event.&quot; Events happen. There is nothing we can do about them and certainly nothing modifiable about them. We're not going to keep trying to say &quot;The method associated with the MouseDown event,&quot; but since we do want to distinguish an automatically run event from a method, like most VFP developers, we shorten it to &quot;the MouseDown event.&quot; </p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

`Init` and `Destroy` events occur when an object is
created and destroyed. These two events fire only once in the life of a
control. This is a good place to establish settings that the control depends
on, and to clean up these settings upon the control's release.

The `Error` event
is the place to put a local routine designed to handle errors that the control
might generate. This is a great place to put specific code in your custom
controls when you anticipate that the user might be able to perform some
error-causing action. You can handle it internally and gracefully within the
control, making the control a more useful black-box object, and, again,
encapsulating the object's behavior. For example, a disk drive combo box, where
you select the drive to which you save your file, could be a useful custom
class. The picker itself should detect that the disk has not been inserted, and
handle the error with a message box rather than passing control to a default
error handler. On the whole, we expect little code to end up in this event.
Under no circumstances should you consider cutting and pasting the same complex
code to handle every conceivable error into all of your top-level subclasses'
`Error` events. Instead, we expect to use Error as part of a larger
error-handling scheme. (See Error in the Reference section.)

The `InteractiveChange`
and `ProgrammaticChange` events allow
you to include code in the control to react to a user's or program's actions
immediately, creating a more responsive system.

Other interactions are handled by events such as `MouseDown`, `MouseUp`, `MouseEnter`, `MouseLeave`, `Click`, `RightClick`, `DblClick`, `Drag` and `KeyPress`. (Some
more esoteric interactions are handled by events such as `MiddleClick` and `MouseWheel`.)
Most of these events are pretty self-explanatory, although the sequence in
which they occur might not always be apparent. An easy way to trace the firing
sequence of events is to use the Event Tracking option in the Debugger, run the
form, try some things and then examine the results. For example, clicking a
command button in a command group (one which previously did not have the focus)
can fire a blizzard of events. In this example, a check box called Check1 had
focus before the click&mdash;we've also pulled out the whole series of `MouseMove`
firings that occurred en route to the button, and left only the last one.

```foxpro
form1.commandgroup1.MouseEnter(0, 0, 162, 98)
form1.commandgroup1.MouseMove(0, 0, 163, 100)
form1.commandgroup1.MouseLeave(0, 0, 163, 101)
form1.commandgroup1.command1.MouseEnter(0, 0, 163, 101)
form1.commandgroup1.command1.MouseMove(0, 0, 163, 101)
form1.commandgroup1.command1.When()
form1.commandgroup1.When()
form1.check1.LostFocus()
form1.commandgroup1.command1.GotFocus()
form1.commandgroup1.Message()
form1.commandgroup1.command1.MouseDown(1, 0, 165, 108)
form1.commandgroup1.MouseDown(1, 0, 165, 108)
form1.Paint()
form1.commandgroup1.command1.MouseUp(1, 0, 165, 108)
form1.commandgroup1.MouseUp(1, 0, 165, 108)
form1.commandgroup1.InteractiveChange()
form1.commandgroup1.command1.Click()
form1.commandgroup1.command1.Valid()
form1.commandgroup1.Valid()
form1.commandgroup1.command1.When()
form1.commandgroup1.When()
form1.commandgroup1.Message()
form1.commandgroup1.Click()
```
Other common events include `Resize`, which fires when a container's size is changed, and `GotFocus` and `LostFocus`, which fire when a control receives and loses focus. 

Beginning with VFP 6, controls have a bunch of events whose
names begin with OLE. These events handle actions related to OLE Drag and Drop.
See ["OLE Drag and Drop"](..\section4\s4g830.html) in the Reference section for an exhaustive
look at this feature.

VFP 6 also added a new wrinkle to events with `Access` and
`Assign`. These events can be attached to any property and fire when the property
is either read or changed. Because the existence of these events is under
developer control, they add a new dimension to controls. (See the Reference
section for details.)

#### Common Control Methods

Methods are similar to events, in that they contain a block
of code to be executed. The main difference is that events are triggered by
something outside the direct control of the developer, but methods are called
explicitly. Compared to events and properties, there are not many common
methods. That's because methods are really the determining factor in creating a
unique control&mdash;unique behaviors of an object indicate that it needs to be
considered a unique control. This is one of the reasons that Microsoft decided
to combine the FoxPro 2.x "Invisible Button" and "Push
Button" controls into a single CommandButton in VFP; they are functionally
identical, differing only in a few properties. However, ComboBox and ListBox
are two separate controls. Although they share a number of methods, there are
enough differences between them to justify separate structures.

The `ZOrder` method
sends the specified control to the front or back of its group of overlapping
controls. ZOrder moves items along the Z-axis, the third dimension we simulate
on our monitors. But ZOrder is not just for appearance; it also affects the
firing order of some events&mdash;see the ZOrder entry in the Reference section for
more details on this. Some controls contain their own ordering properties (such
as Pageframe's `PageOrder`)&mdash;those properties determine the horizontal (X-axis) or
vertical (Y-axis) order of the contents. ZOrder determines the depth (Z-axis)
order.

`Move` allows
movement of controls on a form under programmatic control. `Drag` and `OLEDrag`
initiate native drag and drop and `OLE Drag and Drop`, respectively. 

The `Refresh`
method redisplays a control, also firing the Refresh method of any contained
controls. 

`SetFocus` moves
the focus programmatically to the control (similar to the function performed by
the `_CUROBJ` memory variable in FoxPro 2.x). 

`AddObject`, `NewObject` and `RemoveObject` allow the addition or subtraction of controls from
container objects. `CloneObject`
creates a duplicate of the control inside the same container.

The `SaveAsClass`
method is pretty cool. It allows us to save the definition of any control to a
class library, both at design-time and at runtime! This can be really useful in
an interactive development session, where you can programmatically alter a live
object's properties until you get them just right, and then save your result
right from the Command Window, putting the live form into a visual class
library.

The `SetAll` method
programmatically sets a property of all objects or objects of a particular
class within a container. `ResetToDefault`,
added in VFP 3.0b, lets you return a property to its default value&mdash;very handy,
since a control is created faster when properties are set to default than when
they're explicitly assigned the default value. 

`AddProperty`,
added in VFP 6, lets you add properties to an object at runtime. `ReadExpression`, `ReadMethod`, `WriteExpression`,
and `WriteMethod` let you examine and
change properties and methods programmatically. Except for WriteMethod, they're
available at runtime, as well as design-time. 

`ShowWhatsThis`
displays the WhatsThisHelp for the control.

The remainder of methods built into Visual FoxPro are
typically contained in only a few objects, and are more appropriately discussed
in the reference section for that object.

### Visual FoxPro Controls

Controls can be broken down into groups in a number of ways.
We have chosen to focus on them from the end user's point of view&mdash;what the end
user is going to use each control for. This isn't an exhaustive view of them;
it would take another book at least as long as this one to explore all the
capabilities of each. We're trying to focus more on the use of each control and
to provide some pointers. Further information about specific controls can be
found in the Reference section.

#### Text-based controls: TextBox, EditBox, Label and Spinner

These controls allow you to enter one item of text. A text
box is typically restricted to a few words or phrases, occupying a single line
of form real estate. An edit box, typically bound to a memo field, allows
free-form entry of a variable-length block of text from one word to a large
narrative, providing scrollbars as necessary. A label simply displays text, and
does not allow a user to change it. Spinners are used for numeric entries and
allow both direct text entry and selection by means of up or down arrows.

#### Choices: CheckBox, ComboBox, ListBox and OptionGroup

These controls allow the user to select the most appropriate
answer or answers from a set of choices. Check boxes are used for on/off,
true/false-type answers. Option groups also allow only one answer, though
typically from a larger number of choices. Combo boxes and list boxes allow the
choice of one or more answers from a list. Normally, check boxes and option
groups are defined during the design of a form to have a particular shape and
prompts. The two kinds of lists, on the other hand, tend to be more flexible,
allowing population at runtime. The nice thing about the Visual FoxPro object
model is that the properties of these objects are available at runtime, so the
rules above are typical guidelines and not carved in stone.

Check boxes, in the Windows interface, normally are used
just as an on/off, true/false switch. Occasionally, though, a check box is used
as a button that immediately fires further actions, such as calling up a
dialog. (See the Project Class check box on the Projects page of VFP's Options
dialog, for example.) Our take is that this use of a check box, even when the
prompt ends in an ellipsis, is bad design, since it confuses users. Use buttons
when you need them and save check boxes for indicating if something is or it
isn't.

Option groups also allow only one choice, and are typically
sized and populated with their choices at design-time. You can arrange the
choices in any visual configuration&mdash;you're not limited to rows, columns or even
grids of them.

Combo boxes, formerly known as drop-downs or popups, take up
little real estate when inactive. List boxes take a larger piece of screen
space, but allow the user to see several options at once. Both combo boxes and
list boxes can be populated from a number of sources, ranging from a hard-coded
list entered at design-time to a list programmatically generated at runtime
from an array, table or query. Both can handle multi-column lists. List boxes
have the added advantage of allowing for multiple selection, and for the
addition of mover bars to let the user move things around in the list. Combo
boxes, on the other hand, can be configured to allow the user to enter data not
on the list. Whichever you use, keep in mind that these controls are meant for
choosing from small- to medium-sized lists and not for choosing among thousands
or tens of thousands of options. Your users will *not* be amused as they scroll through the choices one at a time.
(Despite the incremental search available in both controls, some users will
scroll through one at a time.) In general, list boxes are suited to somewhat
larger sets of choices than combo boxes.

Using combos and lists with a huge number of items has been
a perennial source of bugs and performance issues in FoxPro. VFP 3 had problems
with multi-selection of more than about 60 items on a list; FoxPro 2.x actually
crashes under some conditions with 600 or more items in the list. Not only is
this poor interface design for us, but it is also difficult for the Fox team to
program in the Windows environment. Avoid very large data sets for these
controls if at all possible.

#### Actions: CommandButton, Timer and Hyperlink

The action controls are used to fire an action immediately
upon selection. 

Command buttons are variously referred to as "push
buttons" or just "buttons." (For whatever reason, option buttons
are rarely, if ever, called just "buttons.") Command buttons can show
text or a bitmap, or be invisible to create a "hot" region on the
form. (Don't confuse the last option with the Visible property&mdash;an invisible
button is still an active participant in the form, but any control with its
Visible property set to False is both invisible and disabled.) 

Timer controls might seem like a bit of an odd duck in this
category, but timers are unique no matter how you categorize things. They are
the only invisible controls that directly cause actions to occur, unlike the
more passive Custom class objects. But they do cause actions, which is why we
plunked them here. Timers are a welcome addition to our arsenal, allowing us to
dynamically take a look at the current state of a form to check status, update
displays, and so forth.

Hyperlinks, added in VFP 6, are also unusual. Like timers,
they're invisible, but unlike timers, they don't have any special events that
fire on their own. What they do have, though, is a couple of methods useful for
manipulating a browser. The most important is NavigateTo, which can open a
browser looking at a particular Web page or file.

#### Containers: Grid, Column, PageFrame, Page, CommandGroup, Container, Control and Toolbar

Containers are objects that can contain other controls. A
container class is a great place to put a chunk of code that should affect all
of the contained objects, like the logic to turn off navigation buttons when at
the top or bottom of the data set, or to disable visually contained controls
when their container is disabled.

Grids contain columns, which in turn contain other controls.
Some of the contained controls are specific to grids, such as Columns and
Headers, while the individual cells hold the controls suited to the field, like
text boxes, check boxes, combo boxes and the rest. Grids are normally used to
display the contents of a table, like the Browse of old. Unlike Browse, grids
are incredibly configurable, with the ability to use different controls for
different data, change colors and fonts on the fly, and much more. They're also
incredibly difficult to get just right for data entry&mdash;many of the developers we
know would rather climb Mount Everest than configure a grid for entering data.
As a display device, though, or a tool to select a particular record, they're
hard to beat. A fellow developer was heard to say, after evaluating a number of
other ActiveX data grids, that the only thing worse than the VFP Grid was any
other choice. 

Page frames allow the creation of tabbed or tabless sets of
pages. The hottest thing around when VFP 3 first came on the scene, tabbed
dialogs have already fallen out of favor to some extent, but they still have
their uses. A page frame contains pages, which contain controls.

Command groups contain sets of command buttons. These seemed
terribly important when VFP was new, but much less so now. Using individual
buttons provides more control and greater flexibility. Bundling command buttons
with other controls like check boxes and combos in a container provides nearly
all the benefits of command groups, but with added flexibility.

The other three classes in this category, Container, Control
and Toolbar, are not exactly controls in their own right, but they are
container objects. Controls (isn't this confusing?) and toolbars cannot be
directly created from the Form Controls toolbar, unlike the other controls
listed in this section, including Containers.

  <td width="20%" valign="top">
<img width="94" height="94" src="design.gif">

  <td width="80%">
  <p>Yet another mangled piece of overloaded terminology here. The Container class is one of a number of classes, all of which are referred to as &quot;container classes.&quot; To confuse matters more, Control is a class, but &quot;controls&quot; refers to a whole set of classes, and &quot;control&quot; is a general-purpose term for any member of that set. We try to distinguish between the individual Container class and the set of container classes, and between the Control class and the controls, with our use of capitalization, but, as in the heading above, we don't always succeed. It looks like we're stuck with these names for the long term, so bear with us.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

Containers and Controls seem to be very similar. Each is
essentially a box with the standard set of properties and events: border,
background and foreground color and style, size and location, mouse events, and
so forth. Both can contain other controls. The difference between the two is
that a Container object contains other controls whose properties can be
manipulated at design-time and runtime, while a Control hides the individual
controls it contains from manipulation. Control allows you to create true
"black box" controls whose innards are hidden from manipulation
except through your predefined interface, while Container is more of a grouping
mechanism.

A Toolbar is a funny thing. Sometimes it behaves like a
form. Sometimes it's more like a control or a container (lowercase) control.
Unlike the other visual objects, there is no separate Toolbar Designer power
tool. You create a toolbar by defining a class for it, either visually or
through code, and then add it to a form set or create it in code. A surprising
collection of objects can be added to a toolbar. Most common are command
buttons, separators, option buttons, combo boxes and check boxes, with both
kinds of buttons and check boxes normally using a graphical style. (Check out
Word's Formatting toolbar to see all of those control types.) However, the
Class Designer allows the addition of pretty much every VFP control except grids
to a toolbar. That can lead to some pretty strange looking toolbars. In some
versions of VFP, some pretty strange things start to happen, too, when
out-of-the-ordinary controls are thrown on a toolbar. See the Reference section
for details.

#### Graphical Elements: Image, Line, Shape and Separator

These graphical items can be used to segregate related
areas, draw on the form, display images, or separate related groups of buttons
on a toolbar. Unlike the graphical elements in FoxPro 2.x and the Box and Line
methods of forms, these are full participants in the form, and can react to
clicks and drag-and-drop events. (We are amused that Separators are on the Form
Controls toolbar when you can't put them on a form. But the same toolbar is
used in the Class Designer; in addition, a toolbar can be added to a formset in
the Form Designer, so it does make sense.)

#### ActiveX: OLEBoundControl and OLEControl

VFP's ActiveX container controls have some very special
functionality: They allow Visual FoxPro to open a window into another
application, and to control the display and functionality of that application.
OLEControls also are used to add third-party ActiveX controls to forms, giving
the form capabilities beyond those (or better designed than those) built into
VFP.

It's worth noting that Microsoft created a bit of a mess for
itself by including the term "OLE" in the names of these classes.
Since they did that, "OLE" has been transformed into
"ActiveX"&mdash;you'll see a reflection of this in the ToolTip and status
bar message if you pass the mouse over these items on the Form Controls
toolbar.

### User Interface Issues with Controls

Much has been written about the importance of good user
interface design, and we don't want to beat the issue to death here. (Well,
since we're all pretty passionate on this subject, actually we do want to beat
it to death, but we won't.) Check out the appendices for some suggested reading
on this topic if you haven't dealt with this before. A clean, easily understood
and consistent user interface can enhance users' confidence in their abilities
with your system, and improve their opinion that they are dealing with a
polished and professional application.

The most important user interface principle to bear in mind
with controls is consistency throughout an application. If a command button
with a printer icon calls up a print dialog on one form, a check box with the
same icon in another form should not toggle an option that determines whether
the output of an action should be printed. The user is bound to call you,
swearing the application isn't working the way it did yesterday. All forms
should share similar prompts&mdash;when completing a form, the users should not have
to vacillate between selecting "Close," "Cancel,"
"OK" or "Quit" button prompts, if the resulting action on
the different forms is the same.

Think about the way your application is to be used. If the
predominant use of a form is for high-volume, heads-down data entry, requiring
the user to switch from keyboard to mouse to keyboard is murder on efficiency
(and the wrists). On the other hand, a form more likely to be used by someone
trolling for new relationships between the pieces of information should be
tailored to the more creative "What happens if I click here and select
this" operation of a click-happy mouse user. 

Another consideration is accessibility. All controls in your
systems should be accessible by several means. The minimum is to provide
keyboard and mouse access. In many cases, you'll also want a shortcut key and
perhaps a menu option. This is a convenience for power users, who will discover
these shortcuts and use them to run your application faster. But this is more
than an issue of sophistication. Many of your users will have a preference for
the keyboard over the mouse, or vice versa, and the application should be
accessible to them. In addition, users with limited visual or motor skills
should be able to operate your application. As more companies become sensitive
to this issue of making provisions for their disabled workforce, this issue
will become more prominent. Microsoft itself has jumped onto this bandwagon in
the last few years and now offers accessibility guidelines for applications,
and new accessibility features (including an Accessibility Browser) within
Visual FoxPro. See `SYS(2800)` in the Reference section. The bottom line is that
you should plan and design your application from the beginning to accommodate
as many interface styles as reasonably practical.

Finally, let the user know what is going on. Nothing raises
the stress level of a user more quickly than a system that wanders off and
appears to hang when they tell it do go do something. If your application will
take a while to complete a step, change the mouse pointer to an hourglass,
display a progress thermometer or tell the user that the operation will take
some time to complete. Give the user a chance to cancel long operations if she
doesn't have the time or resources to complete a step. Let the user be in
charge.

User interface design is not a subject that comes naturally
to many of us. Study some of your favorite applications to see how they handle
your actions. Maybe more important, study some applications you hate, to see
what makes them so miserable to use&mdash;and be sure not to do those things in your
applications. Read some references in the field. Above all, make the user feel
comfortable, confident and in control.

### Extending the Reach of Controls

The most profound aspect of the many facets of Visual FoxPro
is that the developer is not limited to the functionality built into the
language, but rather that this functionality is the basis from which the
developer can extend the capabilities of Visual FoxPro to the needs of the
client. This is true in many different ways, including controls.

Custom controls are useful in a number of circumstances.
Because controls in an object-oriented hierarchy inherit behavior and
characteristics from their parents, a class hierarchy can make it far easier to
distribute changes throughout a system. For example, changing all the command buttons
in a system to use FixedSys rather than Arial is just a matter of changing the
FontName property in the parent class definition upon which all of your buttons
are built. In addition, encapsulating small bits of thoroughly tested code at
various stages of the class tree ensures a more robust and bug-free final
result. Once you have written solid code for a Next button, preserve that
button in a class library and use that class wherever the button is needed. If
you find a bug in the behavior, you can fix it in one place. If you need
additional functionality in some places, you can subclass and refine the class
definition.

Creating a custom control is easy. Build the control you
want, using a blank form in the Form Designer. (If you spend a lot of your time
developing custom tools, you may find that a custom "workbench" form
can speed the process.) Click the control to select it, and then select the
"Save As Class" option from the File menu. Select a name and location
for the Visual Class Library in which you'd like to store your custom controls,
and then save it. If you prefer, you can just start with the Class Designer&mdash;it
looks a lot like the Form Designer, except that the Run (!) button on the
toolbar is disabled.

There are several ways to use your own controls in the Form
and Class Designers. First, the View Classes button (the one that looks like
books) on the Form Controls toolbar lets you choose among various sets of
classes. You can add your own class libraries using the Add option provided by
that button. To make a particular library available all the time, register it
using the Controls page of the Tools-Options dialog. These visual class
libraries are registered and stored in the Windows Registry, under the entry
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\ Software\ Microsoft\ VisualFoxPro\ &lt;version
number&gt;\Options\VCXList. (Fill in 3.0, 5.0, 6.0, or 7.0 for &lt;version
number&gt;.)

We strongly recommend that you never use the base classes
that come with Visual FoxPro. Create your own set of custom controls,
consisting of all controls available in the default Form Control Toolbar but
subclassed one level. Starting with VFP 6, such a set of controls is provided
for you in the _base library found in the FFC subdirectory of your VFP home
directory. We (and all the experts we know) recommend you do this because the
base class controls supplied by Microsoft cannot be customized and cannot have
custom properties or methods attached to them, whereas the subclassed group you
have created (or the ones in _base) have that ability. (In fact, you'll
probably want to subclass further to give you the ability to change things on
an application level, as well.)

One of the things we find frustrating about VFP is that you
can't make changes across all the controls. If you want to use 24-point Haettenschweiler
throughout all your development, you have to change it in each of your
"base" classes (the ones we just told you to create). Of course, once
you do so, you're done, and when you come to your senses, it's not too hard to
change back to something reasonable again. However, we'd like it even more if
all the VFP base classes derived from a single class, where this kind of change
could be made once. We actually suspect that, internally, this may be true in
VFP 6 and later, but we have no external evidence to back it up.

Custom controls can be built from more than one component.
The Reference section contains an example (under "Container") for
Shapes, where two shapes and a text box are combined to form a thermometer
control. These controls can be turned into a custom class as described
above&mdash;just select all of the controls you want to combine, and then select
"Save As Class". Visual FoxPro automatically dumps the selected
controls into a Container control as part of saving them into a visual class
library. As before, if you know what you want, you can just use the Class
Designer in the first place, drop a Container on it, and add what you need.
Remember to use your subclasses to create these complex objects&mdash;any base class
object you used as part of a custom control cannot have additional properties
or methods attached to it.

Controls are the only means our users have to communicate
with our applications. It's important to provide them with a rich, consistent
and helpful set of tools with which to do their jobs. Visual FoxPro's powerful
built-in controls, combined with the object-oriented structure that allows us
to customize and build upon the capabilities of those controls, provides us
with the means of delivering the tools our clients need.
