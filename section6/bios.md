Della Martin has worked on some of the most unusual FoxPro
and Visual FoxPro applications. She got her start writing a recruiting database
for Duke Basketball while attending Duke University. She has a degree with a
double major in Design and History.
Continuing in the line of non-traditional database
applications, Della worked for Woolpert, an architectural and engineering firm,
where she specialized in GIS work for such diverse applications as water
distribution systems, military master planning, oil well evacuation plans, and
facility management programs. She moved on to the University of Tennessee to
work on a military logistics application, JFAST, perhaps the most well known
VFP application in the world. At nearly every DevCon since 1994, attendees have
seen this cutting-edge application, which includes sophisticated briefing and
analysis tools developed by Della using Automation with many Microsoft
products.
Della now works for TakeNote Technologies ([http://www.takenote.com/](http://www.takenote.com/)), a Developer's Choice
Award winning training and consulting firm, as a developer and instructor.
Della has written for FoxPro Advisor and FoxTalk magazine, and served as a
judge for the 1998 and 1999 Visual FoxPro Excellence Awards. She speaks at
various conferences, including the Great Lakes Great Developers Workshop, VFP
DevConnections, and the Essential Fox conference. The Hacker's Guide to Visual
FoxPro is her second book; she co-authored Microsoft Office Automation with
Visual FoxPro, with Tamar Granor. Della lives in Cary, North Carolina, with her
husband and two children. You can reach Della at [dmartin2@nc.rr.com](mailto:dmartin2@nc.rr.com).
